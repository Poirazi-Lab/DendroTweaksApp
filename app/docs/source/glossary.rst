    **Model**
        In DendroTweaks, a model is a representation of a neuron that contains the morphological data, the membrane mechanisms, stimuli and the means to run simulations.

    **Tree graph**
        A tree graph is a type of a network graph that is composed of nodes connected by edges. 
        In a tree graph, there is only one path between any two nodes.

    **Node**
        A node is a point in a tree graph that is connected to other nodes by edges.

    **Tree traversal**
        Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree graph exactly once.

    **SWC file**
        An SWC file is a file that contains the morphological data of a neuron.

    **Section**
        A section is a part of a neuron that is defined by a set of segments.

    **Segmentation**
        Segmentation is the process of dividing a neuron into segments.

    **Segment**
        A segment is a part of a section that is defined by a set of points.

    **Section Group**
        A section group is a collection of sections that share the same properties.

    **Global parameter**
        A global parameter is a parameter that is shared by all sections of a neuron.

    **Distributed parameter**
        A distributed parameter is a parameter that is different for each section of a neuron.

    **Membrane mechanism**
        A membrane mechanism is a set of equations that describe the behavior of the membrane of a neuron.

    **MOD file**
        A MOD file is a file that contains the equations that describe the behavior of a membrane mechanism.

    **Archive**
        We refer to an archive as a collection of MOD files that can be loaded into a model.
